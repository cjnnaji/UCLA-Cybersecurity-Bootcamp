## 8.3 Lesson Plan: Follow Data Through Layers 2, 3, and 4

### Overview

On the third day of our introduction to networking, students will learn how to gather data from specific networks using enumeration.

Then, we will move through three layers of the OSI model&mdash;Layer 2 (the Data Link layer), Layer 3 (the Network layer), and Layer 4 (the Transport layer). Students will learn the following tools and protocols related to each layer: ARP in Layer 2, ping and traceroute in Layer 3, and TCP and UDP in Layer 4. Class will finish with students performing a SYN scan to search for open ports on a network.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

- Define enumeration as a set of methods used by security professionals and hackers to determine network vulnerabilities.

- Use Wireshark to visualize and analyze ARP activity, including ARP spoofing.

- Use `ping` to determine if hosts are up and accepting connections.

- Use `traceroute` to troubleshoot networking communication issues between two devices.

- Define and distinguish TCP and UDP.

- Analyze TCP traffic in Wireshark.

- Analyze SYN scans to determine the availability of ports on a network.

### Instructor Notes

- **Important:** ICMP does not work from the web lab, be sure to conduct any network related commands from your local machine.  Additionally, remind the students to conduct their network commands from their local machines.

- **11. Student Do: Enumeration with `traceroute`** and the subsequent review are optional. They should be completed if time remains.

### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Introduction (0:05)

Welcome students to the third day of networking, and briefly review the topics of the previous class:

 - Protocols are standardized rules that dictate how data is communicated.

 - Ports assist with where data is transmitted from and to with respect to the server and client.  

 - The seven layers of the OSI model conceptualize how data is communicated across a network.

 - Wireshark is a powerful utility for in-depth analysis of network packets.

Explain that we will cover the following concepts:

- The process of gathering data for a specific network, known as **enumeration**.

- The Layer 2 Data Link protocol **ARP**, used to transfer network traffic within a local network.

- The Layer 3 Network utilities **`ping`** and **`traceroute`**, used by network and security professionals to diagnose network issues.

- The Layer 4 Transport protocols **TCP** and **UDP** and how **TCP** establishes a connection with a three-way handshake.

- **SYN scans** and how both security professionals and attackers can use this method to determine the state of ports in a network.


### 02. Instructor Do: Introduction to Enumeration (0:05)

Explain that, as we've discussed, hackers often try to gain unauthorized access into a network. It's the job of security professionals to secure networks by identifying network vulnerabilities.

Provide the following example:
- A hacker discovers that a server with payroll data accidentally has open port `22`, for SSH.

- This lets the hacker gain unauthorized access to the company's network, allowing them to steal or alter important data such as social security numbers or salary information.

- It is the security professional's job to determine which unauthorized ports are open, and then close them, protecting the integrity of the company.

Explain that the methods that hackers use to find and exploit vulnerabilities are often the same ones used by security professionals to find and patch vulnerabilities.

Explain that one prominent method used by both attackers and security professionals is **enumeration**. Cover the following:

- **Enumeration** is the process of gathering data for a specific network, usually for the purpose of finding ways to gain access to that network.

- Enumeration can provide the following information:
  - Physical addresses of devices in a network
  - The IPs and ports that are used or accessible
  - Network devices and network security devices used

Explain that in today's class, we will introduce how security professionals use protocols and tools that exist in Layers 2, 3, and 4 of the OSI model to enumerate a network.


### 03. Instructor Do: Address Resolution Protocol (Layer 2: Data Link) (0:15)

Reiterate that the reason we are covering the OSI layer protocols and tools is because they contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers to gain unwanted access to networks.

- To harden networks, we need to know how these protocols work and how attackers take advantage of them.  

- We'll begin with the Layer 2 protocol, **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**.

#### A Brief Introduction to ARP

Before looking closely at ARP, we'll recap the process used by networks to communicate with each other over the internet:

- When devices communicate from one network to another, they often send communications across the internet.  
  - This type of network is known as a **wide area network (WAN)**.
- The data then travels across the internet to its destination network.

   - We refer to this destination network as a **local area network (LAN)**.

- Once the data reaches the LAN, it still has to be transmitted to its final destination on the LAN.

Remind students that once on a LAN, the data is routed through network devices called **switches** to a physical machine address.

- The physical address, also referred to as the **media access control (MAC)** address, is a sequence of numbers and letters, such as `00:0c:29:0f:71:a3`, which identifies the destination computer's unique hardware number.

- Without a **MAC address**, the data may reach the LAN, but not know where to next transmit the data.  

Explain that in order to make sure data gets from the LAN to the machine, the ARP, at Layer 2 (data link), maps a physical machine (MAC) address to an IP address within a LAN. This mapping occurs through an ARP request and reply process.

Explain the ARP request and reply process by covering the following:

  - The network device that is transmitting the data broadcasts an **ARP request** to all devices within its network in order to find the physical address that matches the IP address.

  - The device that owns that IP address recognizes its IP in the ARP request. It sends an **ARP reply** with its **MAC address**, so the network knows where to route the data.

  - The mapping of the MAC address to the IP address is added into the **ARP cache**. An ARP cache is a table of entries containing ARP records.

  - The next time that data comes in looking for this specific destination device, it does not need to broadcast another ARP request. Because the network already has the record in its cache, it can automatically route the data.

 Explain that entries added to the ARP cache are called **dynamic ARP entries**, meaning they can be changed with future ARP replies.

  - Dynamic ARP entries only stay in the ARP cache for a limited period of time, known as the **ARP cache timeout**.

  - When the ARP cache timeout expires, the record is removed from the ARP cache and any future requests for the host require a new ARP request.


Explain that Wireshark allows us to visualize ARP requests and responses. Introduce the following demonstration:
  - First, we'll filter for all ARP packets in a .pcap file.

  - This filter will show us the request from the source host, which will include a MAC address, associated with a specific IP address, that the data needs to be transmitted to.

  - If the request can be successfully answered, we'll see a response from the owner of the IP address, which will contain the device's MAC address.

#### ARP Wireshark Demo

Explain that in the upcoming demo, we'll analyze a .pcap file to visualize ARP requests and responses.

 - Open Wireshark.

 - Navigate to `File` > `Open` and select the [arp.pcap](Resources/arp_class.pcap) file.

Once the file is opened, explain that there is a feature in Wireshark that displays the OUI for each MAC address it discovers.  Identifying the OUI can help determine the type of device being observed.  

This feature can be turned on/off by doing the following:

  - Navigate to `Edit` > `Preferences` and select `Name Resolution`.

  - From here, you can turn the `Resolve MAC address` feature on/off.

Explain that we will now begin to filter for all the ARP packets by entering `arp` in the filter.

![A screenshot depicts the ARP filter.](Images/arp_filter.png)

Explain that in this packet capture, there are two different ARP requests and replies:

The first ARP broadcast request can be translated as "*Who has `10.10.10.1`? Tell `10.10.10.2`*."

  - The source host of `10.10.10.2` is making a broadcast message to everyone in the local network to see who owns `10.10.10.1`.
  - The request is also stating, "*If you are the owner, tell me your MAC address so I can add it to my ARP cache.*"
    - This way, `10.10.10.2` will know where to route the traffic for `10.10.10.1` and won't need to ask again.

    ![A screenshot depicts the ARP request.](Images/arp_request.png)

The ARP reply to this request can be translated as "_`10.10.10.1` is at `00:1d:09:f0:92:ab`._"

- The host of `10.10.10.1` is telling `10.10.10.2` that its MAC address is `00:1d:09:f0:92:ab`.

    ![A screenshot depicts the ARP reply.](Images/arp_reply.png)

Explain that there is another ARP request and reply in the packet capture. While the request and reply are the same IPs but in reverse, it  is still an independent request and response, unrelated to the first one.
  - The source host of `10.10.10.1` is making a broadcast message to everyone in the local network to see who owns `10.10.10.2`.
  - `10.10.10.2` then tells `10.10.10.1` that its MAC address is `00:1a:6b:6c:0c:cc`.

    ![A screenshot depicts the ARP request and reply.](Images/request&reply.png)

Let students know that we can also filter our file to show only ARP requests or responses. Doing so can help security professionals isolate certain types of packets when there are many to analyze.

Explain that there is a field for each ARP packet called **`arp.opcode`** that indicates if it is an ARP request or response:

  - If `arp.opcode` is equal to `1`, it is a **request**.

  - If `arp.opcode` is equal to `2`, it is a **response**.

   Run the filter  `arp.opcode == 1` to show only the ARP requests.

   Run the filter `arp.opcode == 2` to show only the ARP responses.

  ![A screenshot depicts how to run the filter.](Images/arp_opcode.png)

Take a moment to address any questions before proceeding.

#### ARP Security Implications

Explain that now that we know how ARP assists with routing data within a LAN, we will look at the **security vulnerabilities** associated with the protocol.

Explain that if a hacker has access to a LAN, they can intercept traffic on its way to the correct destination (known as *the good host*). Cover the following:

- The hacker can send a spoof ARP message to the LAN, directing all traffic intended for the good host to the hacker's MAC address instead.

- After the attacker sends the spoof ARP message, all traffic originally destined for the good host is intercepted by the hacker's device with the malicious MAC address.

- This attack is known as **ARP cache poisoning** or **ARP spoofing**.

Explain that this vulnerability has significant consequences, since it can be used to intercept classified or sensitive data such as usernames and passwords.

Provide the following screenshots to class, which visualize an ARP poisoning attack.

![A screenshot depicts the ARP poisoning attack.](Images/arp_poison.png)

Explain the following about this screenshot:
- The good host is `192.168.47.2` and the good host's correct MAC address is `00:50:56:fd:2f:16`.

- The hacker's MAC address is `00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1`. They sent a spoof ARP message, meaning all future traffic intended for the good MAC address (`00:50:56:fd:2f:16`) instead goes to the hacker's MAC address.

- The spoof ARP message can be translated as "*`192.168.47.2` is at `00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1`.*"

Explain that Wireshark can detect that there are multiple MAC addresses associated with a single IP address.

- Note the message from Wireshark in the screenshot: `Duplicate IP address detected for 192.168.47.2 (00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1) - also in use by 00:50:56:fd:2f:16 (frame 301)`.

- This message from Wireshark is only a warning. No action has been taken by any device.

Explain that there are mitigation methods to protect against an **ARP poisoning attack**.
  - Explain that a network administrator can create **static ARP entries** rather then dynamic ARP entries.

    Cover the following about static ARP entries:

    - Static ARP entries create permanent IP-address-to-MAC-address mappings in the local ARP cache.

    - Unlike the dynamic ARP entries, these cannot be changed.

    - However, it is time-consuming to manually enter and edit each IP-to-MAC mapping in the ARP cache as they are added and changed.

- Additionally, ARP spoofing detection software programs or hardware can be installed to identify and block ARP poisoning attempts.  These can be expensive and often require time to install, maintain, and update.
    
    - Packet filtering firewalls

    - Network devices with ARP anti-spoofing technology

Explain that in the next activity, students will analyze an ARP packet capture and determine if any vulnerabilities exist.

### 04. Student Do: Analyze ARP Activity (0:15)

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity, you will play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom, a software company, hires Acme Corp to do a security assessment of its network.

- Your task is to analyze ARP activity from a CompuCom packet capture to determine if any vulnerabilities exist.

Send students the following files:

- [Activity File: Analyze ARP](Activities/04_Analyzing_ARP/unsolved/readme.md)
- [ARP Log Files](Resources/arp_packets.pcap)



### 05. Instructor Review: Analyze ARP Activity (0:05)

:bar_chart: Run a comprehension check poll before reviewing the activity. 

Note that this activity required the following steps:
   - Opening the packet capture to view ARP requests and responses.

   - Analyzing the ARP responses to determine the physical MAC addresses for each IP address.

   - Further analyzing the packet capture to identify an ARP poisoning attack.

Use the solution guide to review the activity, and encourage students to share their answers before providing solutions.

Send students the following solution file:
- [Solution Guide: Analyze ARP](Activities/04_Analyzing_ARP/Solved)

#### Solution

Open the packet capture file in Wireshark.

- To filter for ARP replies, use the `opcode` filter:

    `arp.opcode == 2`

   This field specifies the nature of the ARP message, in which `1` is a request and `2` is a reply. To find the replies and determine the physical addresses, use the preceding filter.

- Document the physical addresses found for each of the following IP addresses:	 

   - In the field that starts with "Ethernet II," the MAC address is listed as `00:50:56:c0:00:08`.

      - 192.168.47.1

   - In the field that starts with "Ethernet II," the MAC address is listed as `00:50:56:fd:2f:16`.

      - 192.168.47.2

   - In the field that starts with "Ethernet II," the MAC address is listed as `00:0c:29:0f:71:a3`.

      - 192.168.47.200

   - In the field that starts with "Ethernet II," the MAC address is listed as `00:50:56:f9:f5:54`.
   
     - 192.168.47.254

- Further analyze the packet capture to determine if these IPs present any potential security vulnerabilities.

    - Further down in the ARP responses are ARP responses for IP addresses that have already been provided a MAC address. These requests include new MAC addresses.

   - These responses include this message:

      `Duplicate IP address detected for 192.168.47.1 (00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1) - also in use by 00:50:56:c0:00:08 (frame 22)`

   - This is a potential indicator of an **ARP poisoning attack**&mdash;when attackers attempt to submit a malicious server to the ARP cache in order to steal traffic intended for the correct server.

#### Bonus

- Name a few ways to protect against this vulnerability.

  - Creating a static ARP entry in your server can help reduce the risk of ARP poisoning.

  - Third-party tools can identify and alert for potential ARP poisoning attacks.

- Determine the primary vendor for the MAC addresses.  

   - Many web tools can assist with looking up the vendor associated with a MAC address.

   - The web tool at aruljohn.com/mac.pl identifies all the MAC addresses vendors as VMWare.


#### Summary

Note that this exercise introduced the students to the Layer 2 protocol ARP, how ARP requests and responses work, and the security risks they can introduce. Additionally, it demonstrated how MAC addresses are used with ARP.

Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding to the next section.


### 06. Instructor Do: ping (Layer 3: Network) (0:15)

Remind students that the goal of enumeration is to gain access to a particular network.  

Explain that an important step of enumeration is checking if an external host is actually reachable.

  - For example, Company X wants to make sure its new intranet is accessible from its offices in the United States and Japan. The intranet is used for daily employee tasks and to access employee contact information. Therefore, **availability** of the intranet is critical for all employees.

  - To test the accessibility to the intranet, Company X might have employees from the United States and Japan each send a **`ping`** request from their location to validate the intranet is **available** and **accessible** from each location.

Explain that Packet Inter-network Groper (`ping`) is a utility for determining if a particular host is up and accepting requests. Cover the following:

  - `ping` can easily be run from the command line on a Linux, Mac, or Windows machine.

  - As it uses IP addresses, it works on the network layer  (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

Explain that when we ping a host, an **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request** is sent to a specific IP address and then waits on a reply.

  - **ICMP** is a protocol that network devices use to send error messages and operational information about whether a requested service or host can be reached.  Refer to [RFC 1122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt) for additional information.

  - ICMP differs from protocols like UDP and TCP, which we'll cover later on in the lesson, in that it's not usually used to exchange data between systems or by end-user applications, unless that particular application has some diagnostic tools. 
 
  - It is important to note that network devices can be online, but block ICMP requests to "hide" as a security precaution.  

#### ping Demo

Explain that we will now demonstrate how to use `ping` on the command line, using the following scenario:

- You are a restaurant looking to purchase commercial beverages online. You need to check if Pepsi.com is working and accepting requests.

**Important Instructor Note:** Conduct this activity on your local machine and not the web lab. Also note this is a live network request, so there is a possibility of variances in the response.

Begin by opening up your terminal.

- Explain that there are two ways to ping a host: ping the domain or IP address.

First, we'll ping the domain:

- Type `ping pepsi.com`.

- Run the command. A successful response should resemble the following:

  ```bash
	    Pinging pepsi.com [45.60.135.51] with 32 bytes of data:
	    Reply from 45.60.135.51: bytes=32 time=56ms TTL=57
            Reply from 45.60.135.51: bytes=32 time=403ms TTL=57
            Reply from 45.60.135.51: bytes=32 time=52ms TTL=57
            Reply from 45.60.135.51: bytes=32 time=36ms TTL=57

            Ping statistics for 45.60.135.51:
            Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
	    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
            Minimum = 36ms, Maximum = 403ms, Average = 136ms
  ```
Explain that we can end the ping by hitting `Ctrl C`.
- Press `Ctrl` then `C`. (**Note:** Windows stops at four packets by default.)

Explain that we can tell the terminal to ping the website four times by using `-c 4` in the command.
- Type `ping -c 4 pepsi.com` for Linux and Mac or type `ping -n 4 pepsi.com` for Windows.

Next, we'll ping the IP address.  

- Type `ping -c 4 45.60.135.51` or `ping -n 4 45.60.135.51` for Windows.

- The response is the same, except for the top line which should resemble the following:

   ```bash
   Pinging 45.60.135.51 with 32 bytes of data:
   ```

Break down each line of the response:

- `Pinging pepsi.com [45.60.135.51] with 32 bytes of data`:
  - This specifies the domain and the associated IP the request is being sent to, as well as the size of the packet it's sending.

-  `Reply from 45.60.135.51: bytes=32 time=56ms TTL=571`:
    -  This line is a successful response from Pepsi.com confirming the host is reachable. The response includes:

        - **`bytes`**: This is the size, in bytes, of the packet.
        - **`time`**: This refers to the time it took the domain to respond, expressed in milliseconds.
        - **`TTL`** (*time to live*): This concept will be explained later in the lesson.

- `Ping statistics for 45.60.135.51: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)`:
  - Specifies the statistics of the response. For this response, four packets were sent and four received.

  - The "probe" packets sent from the source device are datagrams. Datagrams are basic transfer units used in connectionless communications, as opposed to TCP packets, which are used for connection-oriented communications.  Refer to [RFC 1594](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1594.txt) for additional info regarding datagrams.



  - Emphasize again that we'll cover UDP and TCP in depth later in this lesson.

-  `Approximate round trip times in milliseconds: Minimum = 36ms, Maximum = 403ms, Average = 136ms`:
    - This specifies the statistics of the response times.

Explain to the class that we will now demonstrate a failed response. We will use redbull.com as an example:      

- Run `ping -c 4 redbull.com`.

-  The failed response should resemble the following:

  ``` bash
  Pinging redbull.com [80.120.169.230] with 32 bytes of data:
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.

  Ping statistics for 80.120.169.230:
  Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss)
  ```

Break down the syntax:

  - `Request timed out` indicates that there were no reply messages from redbull.com within the default wait time (typically one second).
  - We can see that four packets were sent, but none were received, meaning there was `100% loss`.

Explain that a failed response doesn't necessarily indicate that the host is down.  It may simply mean that the host is not allowing requests from ICMP.

  - Businesses may restrict ICMP requests for security reasons, such as preventing external parties from enumeration.  

  - A high volume of ICMP requests, called a **ping flood**, also presents a security risk that can potentially affect the server's resources and impact performance.

Explain that security analysts are often tasked with validating hundreds or thousands of IP addresses.  

For those cases, it is not efficient to ping each IP address one at a time.
  - For example, a security professional works at a large e-commerce organization that uses 100 load balancers to handle the large volume of requests coming into its website.

  - All the load balancers are required to be reachable. Otherwise, during peak shopping times its website might have limited availability, leading to poor customer experience.

  - Making individual requests to each load balancer would be too time-consuming.

Explain that for multiple ping requests, there are utilities that can help to automate the process against multiple IPs, or a range of IPs, with a single request. One such tool is **fping**, a utility that can run ping requests against multiple IPs or subnets.

 
Explain that in the next activity, students will get to use `ping` to test connections to several hosts.   

Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding to the activity.

### 07. Student Do: Enumeration with ping Activity  (0:15)

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity, you will play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom, a software company, hires Acme Corp to do a security assessment of its network. CompuCom provides a list of its host IP addresses. The managers are concerned that some of these hosts may have been taken down by an attacker through a DoS attack.

- Your task is to use `ping` to determine which hosts are currently reachable.

- - **Important:** ICMP does not work from the web lab, so be sure to conduct any network related commands from your local machine. 

Send students the following file:

- [Activity File: Enumeration with ping](Activities/07_Enumerating_with_ping/unsolved/readme.md)



### 08. Instructor Review: Enumeration with ping Activity (0:05)

:bar_chart: Run a comprehension check poll before reviewing the activity. 

Use the solution guide to review the activity, and encourage students to share their answers before providing solutions.

Explain that completing this activity required the following steps:

 - Sending a `ping` request to several IP addresses.

 - Analyzing the `ping` responses to determine which hosts are available.


Send students the following file:

- [Solution Guide: Enumeration with ping](Activities/07_Enumerating_with_ping/solved/ReadMe.md)

#### Solution

- Open up a Linux VM to run the `ping` commands.
  	  Run a `ping` request against each of the following IP addresses:

  - `192.0.43.10`
  - `107.191.96.26`
  - `41.19.96.234`
  - `107.191.101.180`
  - `23.226.229.4`
  - `154.226.18.4`
  - `176.56.238.3`
  - `176.56.238.99	`


**Note:** Results may differ since this is a live network ping.

- The command to run the pings will look like:

    `$ ping 192.0.43.10`

- All the IPs except the following three listed will return a successful result:

``` bash
Pinging 192.0.43.10 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.0.43.10: bytes=32 time=75ms TTL=241
Reply from 192.0.43.10: bytes=32 time=29ms TTL=241
Reply from 192.0.43.10: bytes=32 time=44ms TTL=241
Reply from 192.0.43.10: bytes=32 time=30ms TTL=241

Ping statistics for 192.0.43.10:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 29ms, Maximum = 75ms, Average = 44ms`

```

- The three IPs that fail are:

    - `41.19.96.234`
    - `154.226.18.4 `
    - `176.56.238.99`

-  The result failure looks like:

```bash
Pinging 41.19.96.234 with 32 bytes of data:
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.

Ping statistics for 41.19.96.234:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),`    
```


#### Summary

Review that the goal of this exercise was to introduce the Layer 3 utility `ping` and how it can help network and security professionals determine what hosts are accepting and rejecting connections.

Take a moment to address remaining questions before the break.

### 09. Break (0:15)

### 10. Instructor Do: Introduction to traceroute (0:10)

Remind students that in the previous section, we determined if external hosts were up and accepting requests.

- In our demonstration, we saw that redbull.com did not respond to our ping. In this section, we'll try to find out why.

Explain that `ping` only indicates if a host is up or down. Security professionals often need to obtain more information to figure out why a host is not returning a successful response.

- For example:

  - Company X's employees were able to successfully ping their intranet from the United States office, but unable to ping the exact same address from the Japan office.

  - More information is needed to understand why the intranet is not accessible from Japan.

  - Company X can better understand the issue by finding out where in the request the failure occurred.

Explain that when data travels from a source to a destination, it typically does not follow a straight path.

  - Data is often redirected by many routers across various networks. Routers connect different networks so their hosts can communicate.

  - Redirection of data transmissions are called **hops**.

  - Optimal routing paths are determined based on the "shortest path," which is influenced by network topology. This is why knowledge of topology and segmentation is essential to networking.

  - Despite using the "shortest path," communication between two devices can still fail, leaving network administrators unsure where the communication problem is located.

  - Poor connectivity and latency issues are often due to packets being dropped along their routing paths.

Explain that network administrators can use a command-line tool like `traceroute` to troubleshoot networking communication issues between two devices and determine where the issues are in the hops.

Cover the following about `traceroute`:
  - `traceroute` shows the route taken between two systems across a network, listing all routers (hops) the connection must pass through to get to the destination.

  - Network administrators can use `traceroute` to identify precisely where connectivity problems occur. They can see if a problem is close to the source device or destination device or on the path it takes between devices.

  - In addition to troubleshooting connectivity issues, `traceroute` can be used to:

    - Display how systems are connected or map the network.

    - Generate baseline profiles of the network.

    - Diagnose poor network performance issues.


Explain how `traceroute` works by covering the following:

  - Like `ping`, `traceroute` uses ICMP. However, `traceroute` also shows the time taken to travel across each hop from the source to the destination.

  - Each hop is queried three times to validate the accuracy of the data transmission.

  - While using ICMP, the ICMP header contains a field called **time to live (TTL)**.

    - TTL is an indicator of how long a data packet can exist in a network.

    - TTL is a decrementing hop counter. Every router that forwards the packet decrements (reduces) the TTL value by one.

       - For example, if the starting TTL value of a data packet is five, after the data travels across two routers, the TTL will drop to three.

    - When the TTL count reaches zero, it sends a "time exceeded" error message back to the source address.

    - This prevents data from being stuck in an infinite loop if it's unable to be delivered to the destination.

Explain that the source device sends out a sequence of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams to the destination device, covering the following:

  - Initially, three datagrams are sent from the source device, each with a TTL field value set to one.

  - With a TTL value set to one, the datagram will time out as soon as it hits the first router in the path. The router responds with an ICMP time exceeded message (TEM) indicating that the datagram has expired.

  - From there, another three UDP messages are sent, each with a TTL value set to two, which causes the second router to return TEMs.

  - This process continues until the destination device is reached.

  - The visualization in the slide deck demonstrates the sequence of Host A performing a `traceroute` to Host B.

#### traceroute Demo

Explain that now we’ll use `traceroute` on the command line to further investigate why redbull.com isn’t responding.

Note the command syntax for running `traceroute`:

  - `traceroute [domain name or IP address]` or for Windows use `tracert [domain name or IP address]`

Open a terminal in your lab environment:

- Run  `traceroute redbull.com` and show the following output:

  ```
  $ traceroute redbull.com
  traceroute to redbull.com (213.227.189.20), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
   1  _gateway (10.0.2.2)  0.365 ms  0.331 ms  0.312 ms
   2  * * *
   3  * * *
   4  * * *
   5  * * *
  ...
  ```

Explain that `traceroute` on Linux uses UDP by default, which may not pass successfully from our virtual machine. 

In this case, we need to run `traceroute` with ICMP by using the following command:

- Run `sudo traceroute -I redbull.com`.

- `traceroute` results should look like the following:

  **Instructor Note:** Since this is a live network ping, you will see a different result.

  ```bash
  traceroute to redbull.com (213.227.189.20), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

Break down the results:

- `traceroute to redbull.com (213.227.189.20), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets`:

  -  This line indicates the website and IP address that `traceroute` is being run against, as well as the maximum number of hops allowed.

Break down the results at the fourth hop, which is the first hop to our ISP's gateway after our VM NAT and local NAT hops:

- `4  012-034-056-789.res.spectrum.com (12.34.56.789)  15.567 ms  16.471 ms  16.438 ms`:

    - `4` indicates the first hop.
    - `15.567 ms  16.471 ms  16.438 ms`are the three ICMP requests that received a response in 15.567 milliseconds, 16.471 milliseconds, and 16.438 milliseconds.
    - `12.34.56.789` is the first router hop located at `12.34.56.789`.

- `ae2-0.bbr01.anx04.vie.at.anexia-it.net (144.208.208.151)  136.112 ms  131.183 ms  131.704 ms`
  - This line is the fifteenth and last successful hop. Any additional connections didn't receive a response.

- `***` means `request timed out` and indicates that Hop 3 timed out. No additional connections could be established.

From these `traceroute` results, a security or network professional knows they need to narrow their investigation to the router on Hop 15.  

As a comparison, here is the `traceroute` for the successful request to pepsi.com:

  ```bash
  traceroute to pepsi.com (45.60.75.51), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

  Break down the results:

  - `traceroute to pepsi.com (45.60.75.51), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets`:
    - This line indicates the website and IP address that the `traceroute` is being run against, as well as the maximum number of hops allowed.

  - `4  012-034-056-789.res.spectrum.com (12.34.56.789)  *  16.083 ms  16.032 ms`:

    - `4` indicates the first hop.

    - `*  16.083 ms  16.032 ms` are the three ICMP request response times. The first did not get a timely response, while the second and third did, in `16.083 ms` and `16.032 ms` respectively.

    - `10.0.2.2`  is typically the IP address of a local gateway (in this case. a virtual machine network gateway), the first hop.

  -  `12  45.60.75.51 (45.60.75.51)  29.500 ms  30.472 ms  26.195 ms`

      - This is the final hop (the destination). The destination IP of pepsi.com is `45.60.75.51`.

Explain that in the next activity, students will use `traceroute` to analyze the connections that failed in the previous activity.

### 11. (Optional) Student Do: Enumeration with traceroute Activity (0:15)

:warning: **Heads Up:** If there is time in class, you can run this activity.  Otherwise encourage students to work through it on their own. 

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity, you will play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom, a software company, hires Acme Corp to perform a security assessment of its network.

- CompuCom requests that you further analyze the IPs rejected in the last activity to determine where in their path the connection is being dropped.

Send students the following file:

- [Activity File: Enumeration with traceroute](Activities/11_Enumeration_with_traceroute/unsolved)


### 12. (Optional) Instructor Review: Enumeration with traceroute Activity (0:08)

:bar_chart: Run a comprehension check poll before reviewing the activity. 

Remind students that the goal of this exercise was to practice using the ping utility `traceroute` to determine specific points of failure in network transmissions.

Explain that completing this activity required the following steps:

  - Running `traceroute` against the rejected host IP addresses.

   - Analyzing the `traceroute` responses to determine at which point in a transmission a failure occurred.

   - Visualizing the `traceroute` path using a traceroute mapping tool.

Send students the following solution file:

- [Solution Guide: Enumeration with traceroute](Activities/11_Enumeration_with_traceroute/solved)

#### Solution

Open up a Linux terminal to run the ping commands.

 Run `traceroute` against the IP addresses from the last activity that returned a failed response.

- The IPs that had a failed response were:

	- `41.19.96.234 `
	- `154.226.18.4`
	- `176.56.238.99`

- To run traceroute with the ICMP flag:
  - Run `sudo traceroute -I 41.19.96.234`.

Determine where in their transmission (at which hop) the transmission failed.

- The responses will likely be different as each class is on a different network. Here is a sample response for reference:

  ```bash
      Tracing route to vc-gp-n-41-19-96-234.umts.vodacom.co.za [41.19.96.234]
      over a maximum of 30 hops:

      1     *        *        2 ms  10.0.0.1
      2    24 ms    32 ms    15 ms  96.120.5.249
      3   100 ms   438 ms    47 ms  ae31-sur03.a2atlanta.ga.atlanta.comcast.net [68.85.32.225]
      4    43 ms     9 ms   322 ms  96.108.116.41
      5     *        *        *     Request timed out.

  ```

  In this example, the transmission failed at the fifth hop.

Document a summary of your findings using a [traceroute mapping tool](https://stefansundin.github.io/traceroute-mapper/).

- Copy and paste the `traceroute` results and place them in the top field on the website stefansundin.github.io/traceroute-mapper.

- Click `Map it!`

Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding to the next section.


### 13. Instructor Do: TCP is as Easy as 1-2-3 (0:15)

Remind students that so far we've looked at the ARP from Layer 2 and the `ping` and `traceroute` utilities from Layer 3.

Explain that we're moving on to Layer 4 (transport). Review the following:

- The Transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication over a network.

 - The Transport layer takes the data from the preceding layers, breaks it up into smaller packets, and *transports* the packets to the destination.

 - The recipient reassembles these packets into a complete message.


Explain that we'll look at two Layer 4 protocols that assist with these communications: **TCP** and **UDP**.

#### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Explain that **TCP** is one of the most widely used protocols for data transmission. Cover the following:

  - TCP is part of a collection called the internet protocol suite. This suite is commonly referred to as the TCP/IP model.
  
   	- The TCP/IP model is similar to the OSI model and references many of the layers.
     
  	- Review the following image to visualize how the OSI model relates to the TCP/IP model.	

![A diagram depicts the relationship between the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.](Images/tcp-ip_model.png)

  - TCP is considered a connection-oriented protocol, meaning that the recipient (the server) must acknowledge when it receives a request from the client.

  - If the recipient doesn't acknowledge receiving the request, the sender assumes the request has not been received and will attempt to resend.

  - TCP will always set up and confirm a connection before making a request.

  - Connection-oriented protocols such as TCP are also considered reliable protocols because they ensure that all data is transmitted without error and in the correct order.

  - For this reason, TCP is used when all transmitted data must be received and is used with familiar protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and SMTP.


    - For example, we want to check our transaction history on an online banking website.

      - We would use HTTPS, a protocol that runs over TCP. It ensures that all the requested data from our banking transaction history has been transmitted from the bank's web server.

    - Banking customers need to trust the integrity of the data they are viewing, so it is critical that banking transaction data is complete and error-free.

Explain that since TCP requires assurances that complete data will be transmitted between a client and a server, the process must notify both sides that data has been completely transmitted.

Explain that this connection occurs through a **TCP three-way handshake**.

Explain that the three-way handshake process is broken down into three steps:
  1. **SYN** (*Synchronize*): From client to server
  2. **SYN/ACK** (*Synchronize/Acknowledge*): From server to client
  3. **ACK** (*Acknowledge*): From client to server

Explain the steps in more detail:
  - In the first SYN step, the client sends a SYN data packet to the server to determine if it is ready to open a connection.

  - In the second SYN/ACK step, the server acknowledges or confirms receipt of the SYN packet.

  - In the the third ACK step, the client confirms receipt of the SYN/ACK packet.

  - Once the handshake is successfully completed, the data transmission can begin.

Explain that after the data has been transmitted, TCP uses a **four-way termination** process to terminate the connection. Cover the following:

- The four-way termination process is broken up into four steps:
  1. **FIN** (*Finish*): From client to server   
  2. **ACK** (*Acknowledge*): From server to client    
  3. **FIN** (*Finish*): From server to client
  4. **ACK** (*Acknowledge*): From client to server

- In the first FIN step, the client sends a FIN data packet to the server to close the connection.

- In the second ACK step, the server acknowledges receipt of the FIN packet.

- In the third FIN step, after the server terminates the connection, it sends a FIN packet.

- In the fourth ACK step, the client acknowledges it has received the server's FIN packet. The TCP termination process is complete.


Explain that while TCP can ensure that all data has been transmitted in the correct order, there are some disadvantages to this protocol. Cover the following:

 - In some cases, retransmissions (when the server resends packets because the client does not acknowledge receipt) and the ordering of packets cause delays during data transmissions.

- In cases when every single packet of data does not need to be transmitted, TCP is not used.
  - For example, while streaming a live concert on YouTube, the quality may waver because some packets are not delivered.

  - However, the video does not buffer or pause. It's better that the stream loses video quality for a moment than the video pauses until all the data is received at the highest quality.

  For such situations, when it's not necessary that all data reaches its destination, there is the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**.

#### UDP

Explain that in situations for which complete data transmission is not the priority, we can use another protocol called UDP.  

Cover the following about UDP:

  - UDP is better for reducing latency versus transmitting all data.

  - UDP is considered a **connectionless protocol**, as it does not require a handshake to transmit data.

  - UDP simply sends off the packets. The attitude of UDP is, "If all the packets are received, great. If not, that's okay too."


Remind students that we used UDP datagrams when sending `ping` and `traceroute` requests, because if we didn't get the response we wanted, we were able to ask for it again.

  - Another example of where we might use UDP is with voice over internet protocol (VoIP), used for making voice calls, because we can deal with some amount of loss in these cases.

#### TCP Demo

Explain that now we will demonstrate how the **TCP three-way handshake** works in Wireshark:

  - Log into Wireshark and open [3wayhs.pcapng file](Resources/3wayhs.pcapng).

Explain that this .pcap is a depiction of the TCP three-way handshake that takes place when a website is accessed.

  - Note each packet represents a different step of the handshake. Note the packet for the SYN, the packet for the SYN/ACK, and the packet for the ACK.

  ![A screenshot depicts the TCP three-way handshake packets.](Images/3wayhs.png)

Select the SYN packet from the packet list and expand the TCP details from the packet details.

  - Explain that the step of the handshake is indicated in a **flag**, which is a field in the **TCP header**.

  - The fields are used to tell the receiver of the packet which flag is used.

  - The value of the flags can either be **`1` for on** or **`0` for off**.

    - For example, in the SYN request (displayed in the following image), we can see the SYN's flag field is set to `1` (**on**), indicating that it is in use. All the other fields are `0`, meaning only SYN is being used.

    ![A screenshot depicts that the SYN flag is set.](Images/synflag.png)

Select the SYN/ACK packet from the packet list and expand the TCP details from the packet details.

- Explain that in the SYN/ACK response (displayed in the following image), the flag fields for SYN and ACK are set to `1`.

   ![A screenshot depicts the SYN/ACK response.](Images/synackflag.png)

Explain that with Wireshark filters, you can easily isolate certain steps of the three-way handshake.  

- The filters are based on the flag field set in the TCP header. For example:

  - To view only SYN requests with the SYN flag set to `1` and the ACK flag set to `0`, run:

    `tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`

  - To view only SYN/ACK responses with the SYN flag set to `1` and the ACK flag also set to `1`,  run:  

    `tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1`


  - To view only ACK responses with the ACK flag set to `1` and the SYN flag set to `0`, run:

    `tcp.flags.syn == 0 && tcp.flags.ack == 1`

   ![A screenshot depicts the SYN filter.](Images/synfilter.png)    

     - To view TCP termination packets with the FIN flag set to 1,  run:

        `tcp.flags.fin == 1`

Conclude this section by explaining that Wireshark can also easily distinguish between the client and server in these TCP handshakes:

  - Remove all filters, and explain that the client IP is `10.0.2.15` and the server IP `93.184.216.34`.

    - In the SYN request, the client IP is the source and the server IP is the destination.

    - In the SYN/ACK response, the client IP is the destination and the server IP is the source.
    - In the ACK response, the client IP is the source and the server IP is the destination.

   - Remind the class that in order to see the domain of the web server being accessed, you can select:

     `View` > `Name Resolution` > `Resolve Network Address`

   - Explain that after this has been selected, the website being accessed is clearly shown as `example.com`:

     ![A screenshot depicts the domain of a web server.](Images/examplecom.png)

Explain that in the next activity, students will get to use Wireshark to analyze TCP three-way handshakes and terminations.

Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 14. Student Do: Analyze TCP Traffic Activity (0:15)

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom hires Acme Corp to do a security assessment of its network.

- CompuCom requests that you analyze a new employee's TCP traffic to determine what they worked on in their first week.

Send students the following files:

- [Activity File: Analyze TCP Traffic](Activities/14_Analyzing_TCP_Traffic/unsolved)
- [New Employee TCP Packet Capture](Resources/packetcapTCPclass.pcapng)


### 15. Instructor Review: TCP Traffic Activity (0:05)

:bar_chart: Run a comprehension check poll before reviewing the activity. 

Explain that this activity was designed to introduce the Layer 4 protocol and TCP and practice identifying how TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection with a remote host.  

Completing this activity required the following steps:

   - Loading a TCP packet capture with Wireshark.

  - Finding all establishing TCP handshakes in the packet capture.

  - Finding all TCP terminations in the packet capture.

   - Determining what websites were visited by analyzing the TCP traffic.

Send students the following solution file:

- [Solution Guide: Analyze TCP Traffic](Activities/14_Analyzing_TCP_Traffic/solved)

#### Solution

In Wireshark, open the [packetcapTCP.pcapng](Resources/packetcapTCPclass.pcapng) file.

Find all the TCP handshakes for establishing a connection.

- There are three three-way handshakes in the packet capture.

To find them, do the following:

- To view only the three SYN requests, run:  

  `tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`

- To view only the three SYN/ACK responses, run:

  `tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1`

- To view only the three ACK responses, run:

  `tcp.flags.syn == 0 && tcp.flags.ack == 1`

  **Note:** This may show some extra packets, including the FIN packet. To isolate only the three packets, run:

  `tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1 && tcp.flags.fin == 0`


Find any TCP terminations.

- In the packet capture, there is one TCP termination from `Src: 209.202.133.24`.

- To filter for terminations, run:

  `tcp.flags.fin==1`

 Use your findings to determine what websites the employee visited during their first week of work.

- To determine what websites were visited, translate the network IP address to the domain name.

  - Click on `View` > `Name Resolution` > `Resolve Network Address`.

  - After `Resolve Network Address` has been selected, the remote hosts the user accessed display as:

    - `travelocity.com`
    - `trivago.com`
    - `cruises.com`

Based on these results, we can determine that the new employee is planning a vacation.

Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding to the next section.


### 16. Instructor Do: SYN Scan (0:15)

Remind the class that in the previous class, we discussed that ports are like the "doors" to a network. It is critical for security professionals to be sure that these doors are not open to unauthorized users. Use the following as an example:

  - Company X recently set up a new network in its London office. A security administrator needs to ensure that the only ports open on the machines are `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS), since incoming and outgoing web traffic is allowed for their employees.

  - If ports other than HTTP and HTTPS are open, there is a risk that a hacker could access the network and view confidential user and password info or impact the availability of the network by taking down a machine.

Explain that we can check for open ports on a network by sending a SYN request to every port on that network. If we receive a SYN/ACK response, the port is open.

Explain that this enumeration process of sending SYN requests to many ports on a network is called a **SYN scan**. Cover the following:

  - A SYN scan is typically run by a software program that automates the sending of the SYN requests.

  - If a server responds with a SYN/ACK response, the client will not complete the three-way handshake with an ACK response.

  - The sole purpose of the SYN scan is to determine the current **state** of the ports on a network.

Explain that there are three main port states: **open, closed**, and **filtered**.
  - **Open** means the port is accepting connections.
  - **Closed** means the port is not accepting connections.
  - **Filtered** means the port may be open, but a firewall or another network device is likely blocking it.

Explain that in order to figure out the states of the ports, we can use Wireshark to view the behavior of a **conversation** with the port.

 - Remind the class that a **conversation** is the traffic (requests and responses) between a specific IP and port combination.

 - The behavior of the conversation we would analyze is the **count of packets** sent in requests and responses for the specific port state.

 - If we determine the behavior of these three different port states, we can quickly determine the states of all the ports when we view the summary of all conversations.

Explain that the SYN scan results for different machines need to be analyzed separately, as there often are small differences in the conversation behaviors.

  - The differences depend on either the program running the SYN scan or the type of server responding to the SYN requests. For example, some machines may respond with three packet replies for an open port and some may reply with one.

  - The differences can also depend on the operating system of the machine being scanned or the firewall of the machine.

#### SYN Scan Demo

Explain that in the upcoming demonstration:

  - We will be security analysts at Company X tasked with analyzing the ports from the machine recently set up in London.

  - Company X is concerned that the networking team who set up the new machine left ports open, putting the company at risk of unauthorized access.

  - Company X's security manager ran a SYN scan against the machine. We will analyze the results to determine which  open ports can put Company X at risk.

Explain to the class that we will use Wireshark to analyze the results of the SYN scan run against Company X.

- Log into wireshark and pull up the [synscandemo.pcapng](Resources/synscandemo.pcapng) file.

Explain that we will first filter for only TCP packets by entering `TCP` in the filter.

Explain that there are many SYN requests, all from the same source IP, which belongs to the security manager who ran the SYN scan. In each request, they are checking a different port.

#### View Behavior of an Open Port

Explain that since an open port will respond with SYN/ACK, we will use the filter from the previous exercise to look for SYN/ACK responses.

- Enter the following filter:

  `tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1`

Explain that you can see the two open ports responding with a SYN/ACK are port `22` (SSH) and port `80` (HTTP). We did expect port `80` (HTTP) to be open for web traffic, but we *did not* expect port `22` (SSH) to be open.  

Explain that we will recommend mitigating this issue after all the ports are reviewed.

  ![A screenshot depicts the source ports shown in the SYN scan.](Images/synscanports.png)

Next, we will follow the whole TCP conversation of one port in order to see the behavior of an open port.

- To view the conversation:

  - Right-click the port `80` packet.
  - Select `Follow` > `TCP Stream`.

    ![A screenshot depicts how to view the TCP Stream.](Images/synscanfollow.png)

Explain that in the packet capture pane, you can see the whole conversation for that specific port. Cover the following:

- You can see the SYN for the request to check if the port is open.

- The server responds with a SYN/ACK that the port is open.

- The client sent over a **reset**, or **RST**, message to the server. This message tells the server to terminate the connection if not already terminated.

- The important takeaway is that in this SYN scan, the behavior of an open port is three packets in a conversation.


   ![A screenshot depicts the SYN scan reset.](Images/synscanrst.png)


#### View Behavior of a Filtered Port

Explain that servers typically do not respond with any message for filtered ports. We'll follow port `113`'s TCP conversation as an example.

- Select `Follow` > `TCP Stream`.

  ![ A screenshot depicts the TCP Stream of port 113.](Images/port113.png)

Explain that this is an example of a filtered port, where there is only a SYN request and no response of any kind from the server as it is likely dropped by the firewall.

   ![A screenshot depicts the no response with a filtered port.](Images/port113B.png)

- The important takeaway is that in this SYN scan, the behavior of a filtered port is one packet in a conversation.


 #### View Behavior of a Closed Port

Explain that for a closed port, the server often responds with an RST flag to indicate that it's not accepting connections. This response is configurable on the server's settings. We'll follow port `199`'s TCP conversation as an example.

   - Select `Follow` > `TCP Stream`.

  ![A screenshot depicts the TCP Stream of port 199.](Images/port199.png)

Explain that this is an example of a closed port, where there was only a SYN request and a response of RST/ACK from the server that it is not accepting connections.

  ![A screenshot depicts the RST/ACK response of a closed port.](Images/port199B.png)

- The important takeaway is that in this SYN scan, the behavior of a closed port is two packets in a conversation.

Summarize by explaining that the SYN scan in Wireshark depicted the following behaviors for Company X's London machine's ports:

  - Open ports have three packets.

  - Filtered ports have one packet.

  - Closed ports have two packets.


Explain that now we need to get the states of all the ports in the scan by viewing all the conversations:
- Select `Statistics > Conversations`.

- When the conversations window opens, select `TCP`.
- Sort by `Packets Descending`.

Explain that we can see the ports that have three packets (open) and the ports that have two packets (closed).

- Scroll down to see the filtered ports with one packet.

![A screenshot depicts the SYN scan conversations.](Images/synconversations.png)

We can conclude that:
  - Ports `80` and `22` are open.
  - The other ports are either closed or filtered, which means they are likely protected by a firewall.

Since Company X's London machine is only supposed to allow web traffic on ports `80` and `443`, we must recommend that the network administrator needs to close port `22` immediately.

#### Demo Summary

Conclude this demonstration with the following summary:

  - All of the SYN requests going from port to port were expected. We knew a SYN scan had been run by the security manager.

  - However, if a SYN scan had not been planned, this would be unusual network activity that would need to be looked into.

 - If a security professional saw this activity, they would want to consider using a firewall to block the source IP from scanning their network, as a hacker could use the exact same SYN scan process for malicious reasons.

Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding to the next section.

Explain that in the next activity, students will analyze a SYN scan to determine which ports are open, closed, and filtered.


### 17. Student Do: Analyze a SYN Scan Activity (0:20)

Explain the following to students:

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom requests that you analyze a packet capture of a SYN scan it ran against one of its hosts. You must determine what ports are open, closed, and filtered.

Send students the following files:

- [Activity File: Analyze a SYN Scan ](Activities/17_Analyzing_SYN_Scan/unsolved)
- [SYN Scan Packet Capture](Resources/synscan.pcapng)



### 18. Instructor Review: SYN Scan Activity (0:05)

:bar_chart: Run a comprehension check poll before reviewing the activity. 

This activity demonstrated how a SYN scan can be used by a network professional to determine the state of a communication port without establishing a full three-way connection.

The students used Wireshark to visualize a SYN scan and then learned how to interpret the results to see the different states of several ports.


Completing this activity required the following steps:

   - Loading the packet capture with Wireshark.

   - Analyzing the SYN scan to determine what ports are open, filtered, and closed.

Send students the following file:

- [Solution Guide: Analyze a SYN Scan ](Activities/17_Analyzing_SYN_Scan/solved)

#### Solution

In Wireshark, open the `synscan.pcapng` file.

Analyze the SYN scan to determine what ports are open.

- An open port would show the following five steps:
   1. SYN request
   2. SYN/ACK response
   3. SYN/ACK response
   4. SYN/ACK response
   5. SYN/ACK response

- To analyze the open ports:

   - Navigate to `Statistics` > `Conversations`.
   - Select the `TCP` tab.
   - Sort descending by packets.

- The three open ports with five packets are `53`, `80`, and `22`.


Analyze the SYN scan to determine what ports are closed.


- A closed port shows the following two steps:

   1. SYN request
   2.  RST/ACK response

- To analyze the closed ports:

   - Navigate to `Statistics` > `Conversations`.
   - Select the `TCP` tab.
   - Sort descending by packets.

- The four closed ports with two packets are `113`, `25`, `31337`, and `70`.


Analyze the SYN scan to determine what ports are filtered.


- A filtered port would show the following step:

   1. SYN request

- To analyze the filtered ports:

   - Navigate to `Statistics` > `Conversations`.
   - Select the `TCP` tab.
   - Sort descending by packets.

- The filtered ports are all the other ports that are not open or closed. There are many of them.


Take a moment to address remaining questions before dismissing class for the day.
